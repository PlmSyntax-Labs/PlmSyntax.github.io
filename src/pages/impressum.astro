        <h2>Liability for Content</h2>

          investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the
          use of information under general law remain unaffected.

        <p>
          Our website may contain links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no
          influence. We therefore cannot accept any liability for this external content. The respective
          provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for the content of the linked
          pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.

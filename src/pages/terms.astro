        <h2>4. Pricing and Payment</h2>
        <p>
          All prices are listed in EUR and are exclusive of VAT (Mehrwertsteuer) where applicable.
          VAT will be added in accordance with German tax law. Licenses are one-time purchases with
          no recurring fees. Payment is due upon purchase.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Right of Withdrawal (Widerrufsrecht)</h2>
        <p>
          As a consumer within the EU, you have the right to withdraw from your purchase within 14 days
          of receipt without giving any reason, in accordance with Section 312g BGB and the EU Consumer
          Rights Directive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Exception:</strong> The right of withdrawal expires prematurely if execution of the
          contract has begun with your express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose
          your right of withdrawal (Section 356(5) BGB), for example upon download or activation of
          the license key.
        </p>
        <p>
          To exercise the right of withdrawal, contact us at {legal.legalEmail} with a clear statement
          of your decision.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Warranty (Gewaehrleistung)</h2>
        <p>
          Warranty claims are governed by the statutory provisions of German law (Sections 434 ff. BGB).
          The limitation period for warranty claims is two years from delivery for consumers and one year
          for business customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We warrant that the software substantially conforms to its documented specifications at the
          time of delivery. We do not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability (Haftungsbeschraenkung)</h2>
        <p>
          Our liability is governed by the following provisions in accordance with German law:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We are fully liable for damages caused by intent or gross negligence.</li>
          <li>
            For slight negligence, we are only liable for breach of essential contractual obligations
            (Kardinalpflichten). In such cases, liability is limited to foreseeable, typically occurring
            damages.
          </li>
          <li>
            The above limitations do not apply to damages arising from injury to life, body, or health,
            or to claims under the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Data Processing</h2>
        <p>
          {siteConfig.name} processes all data locally on your machine. No PLMXML data or processing
          results are transmitted to us or any third party. For details on how we handle personal data
          collected through this website, see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          {siteConfig.name} software, including all code, documentation, graphics, and trademarks, is
          protected by copyright and intellectual property laws. All rights not expressly granted remain
          with {siteConfig.name}.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          The perpetual license remains valid indefinitely unless terminated. We may terminate the
          license if you materially breach these terms and fail to cure the breach within 30 days of
          written notice. Upon termination, you must uninstall the software and delete all copies.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding the
          UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). For business
          customers, the exclusive place of jurisdiction is Munich, Germany. For consumers, the
          statutory provisions on jurisdiction apply.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR) at
          <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>.
          We are neither obligated nor willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings
          before a consumer arbitration board.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Severability (Salvatorische Klausel)</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
          provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be replaced
          by a valid provision that comes closest to the economic purpose of the invalid provision.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify these Terms for future purchases. Changes do not affect
          existing licenses. The current version is always available on this page.
        </p>
